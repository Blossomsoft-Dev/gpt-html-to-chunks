INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR HTML SPLITTING SCRIPT

----------

GOAL
This script is designed to split a very large HTML file into smaller chunks. It requires XAMPP for setup and execution.

----------

IMPORTANT
This script may not work if OpenAI changes the structure of its export files in the future.

----------

SETUP
Move this current folder to XAMPP's htdocs Directory. Example:
htdocs/html_to_chunks/

----------

EXPORT CHAT HISTORY
In the ChatGPT platform, export your chat history. Unzip the files and place them in the source/ folder. Example:
htdocs/html_to_chunks/source/ (Drag the files from the .rar archive there)

If OpenAI hasn't changed their export scheme, you should see the following files in the folder:

chat.html
conversations.json
message_feedback.json
model_comparisons.json
user.json

----------

VERIFY PRE-MADE FILES
The dest/ folder already contains a pre-made style.css file for styling the output. Example:

htdocs/html_to_chunks/dest/style.css

----------

START XAMPP
Ensure XAMPP is running, with both Apache and MySQL services started.

----------

RUN THE SCRIPT
Open a web browser and navigate to the script's execution file. Example:

localhost/html_to_chunks/execute.php

----------

CHECK FOR RENDERED FILES
The smaller html chunks should be in the destination folder. Example:
htdocs/html_to_chunks/dest/foo.html

Those are the new files you should keep and archive.

----------

OPTIONAL: USE STAGSI FOR TAGGING
Install Stagsi and import the generated HTML files into the program. Stagsi's tagging feature will allow you to organize and label the files for quick access.
